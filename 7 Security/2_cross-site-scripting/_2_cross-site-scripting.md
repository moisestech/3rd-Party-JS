# Cross-Site Scripting

## **7.2 Cross-site Scripting**

If there’s one common source of embarrassment for web application developers, it’s
cross-site scripting—or as it’s commonly known, XSS. This particular vulnerability is
responsible for many different successful attacks—from funny pranks like causing

Facebook to appear styled like MySpace,2

to potentially disastrous wrongdoings like
financial fraud. Cross-site scripting is a type of vulnerability that enables attackers to
inject their own code into web pages viewed by other users. This is by far the most
common source of attacks in modern web applications, including third-party
JavaScript applications. According to Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Report,3
XSS was responsible for an astounding 80% of all security vulnerabilities documented
by its authors in 2007.
In this section, we’ll show you what XSS attacks look like, explain how they work,
and show you how to defend your own application against such attacks. Let’s get
started.
