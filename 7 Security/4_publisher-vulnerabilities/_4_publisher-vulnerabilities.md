# Publisher Vulnerabilities

## **7.4 Publisher Vulnerabilities**

Although most of the time you’ll be dealing with vulnerabilities arising from cross-site
scripting and cross-site request forgery, there are other vulnerabilities—old and new—
that attackers can use to break into your web application. We’d love to cover them all,
but they deserve a separate manuscript devoted to the topic of web application security.

So, for the remainder of this chapter, we’ll focus on a particular subset of vulnera-
bilities involving publishers. Unlike traditional web applications, third-party apps

involve multiple parties, and one of these—the publisher—can’t necessarily be
trusted. Because you’re executing (at least some of) your application code on their
page, they have a unique vector through which your application might be attacked—
intentionally and sometimes even unintentionally. In this section, we’ll briefly go over
the most common of these vulnerabilities: publisher impersonation, clickjacking, and
denial of service.
