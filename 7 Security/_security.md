# 7️⃣ Security

1. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
2. Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
3. Publisher impersonation, clickjacking, and denial of service.

## **7.1 Cookies, Sessions, and Session Theft**

## **7.2 Cross-site Scripting**

## **7.3 Cross-site Request Forgery**

## **7.4 Publisher Vulnerabilities**

## **7.5 Summary**

- We started this chapter with:
  - **a refresher on cookies**,
  - and **then walked through different types of web application vulnerabilities**:
    - **cross-site scripting**,
    - **cross-site request forgery**,
    - and a number of **vulnerabilities that either affect or are caused by publishers**.
- The important lesson here is that **you should never underestimate or shelve the problem of keeping your third-party application secure**.

- As we said in the introduction to this chapter, the stakes are high for everyone and especially for you—the third-party JavaScript application provider.
- Not only do **users trust you with their data, but so do publishers with their online properties**.
- That’s why **you have to think about security implications at all stages of your application’s development**.
- There’s no silver bullet when it comes to defending yourself against different types of attacks.
- You’ll probably have to use all the techniques we showed in this chapter plus invest time in additional research.
- Web application security is a fun and thriving subject and, in case you’re interested in further exploring it, we recommend you take a look at the **Web Application Hacker’s Handbook (Wiley, 2008)** — a great resource on web application security.
- As for us, it’s time to move on.

#### Next Chapter

[[_3rd-party-js-SDK]]

- In the next chapter, we’ll revisit some assumptions we’ve made about distributing and deploying a third-party application.
- Instead of relying solely on self-executing applications deployed using script-include snippets, we’ll look at how you can package your apps as complete JavaScript libraries, or third-party JavaScript SDKs.
