# 9Ô∏è‚É£ Performance

1. **Minimizing initial payload**
2. **Reducing network requests**
3. Minimizing **impact on the publisher‚Äôs page**
4. Controlling **expensive JavaScript calls**
5. Improving **perceived performance**

## **9.1 Optimizing Payload**

## **9.2 Optimizing Javascript**

## **9.3 Perceived Performance**

## **9.4 Summary**

- This chapter was all about making your application **load**, **run**, and **feel faster**.
- You learned that the best way to make your third-party JavaScript application faster is by:

  - **reducing the initial payload**
  - **deferring the expensive parts of your application** until they‚Äôre absolutely necessary
  - and **making sure you‚Äôre not bombarding your browser with DOM reflows and repaints**.

- And for parts that can‚Äôt be optimized any further,
  - you can **increase user satisfaction by improving the perceived performance of your widget**.
- No matter what kind of a third-party JavaScript application you‚Äôre working on,
  - you should always consider applying knowledge you acquired in this chapter.
- But don‚Äôt stop there‚Äîpick up books we recommended, go play with **jsPerf**,
  - and watch videos of talks about front-end performance.
- The more you learn about performance,
  - the less likely you are to waste your time on a **premature optimization** which, as we know, is the root of all evil.

#### Next Chapter

[[_debugging-testing]]

- Our last chapter, ‚ÄúDebugging and testing,‚Äù will show you what to do when things go wrong and how to make sure that you don‚Äôt repeat old bugs over and over again.
- We‚Äôll talk about writing automated tests for your widget and debugging it both on your development environment and‚Äîmore exciting‚Äîin production.
- Onward!
