5. Improving **perceived performance**

## **9.1 Optimizing Payload**

## **9.2 Optimizing Javascript**

## **9.3 Perceived Performance**

## **9.4 Summary**

- This chapter was all about making your application load, run, and feel faster.
- You learned that the best way to make your third-party JavaScript application faster is by reducing the initial payload, deferring the expensive parts of your application until they’re absolutely necessary, and making sure you’re not bombarding your browser with DOM reflows and repaints.
- And for parts that can’t be optimized any further, you can increase user satisfaction by improving the perceived performance of your widget.
- No matter what kind of a third-party JavaScript application you’re working on, you should always consider applying knowledge you acquired in this chapter.
- But don’t stop there—pick up books we recommended, go play with jsPerf, and watch videos of talks about front-end performance. The more you learn about performance, the less likely you are to waste your time on a premature optimization which, as we know, is the root of all evil.
- Our last chapter, “Debugging and testing,” will show you what to do when things go wrong and how to make sure that you don’t repeat old bugs over and over again.
- We’ll talk about writing automated tests for your widget and debugging it both on your development environment and—more exciting—in production.
- Onward!
