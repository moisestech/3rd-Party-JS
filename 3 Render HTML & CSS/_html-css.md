## **3.5 Summary**

- For a third-party JavaScript application, **injecting HTML and CSS into the publisher’s page requires more care than if you were adding markup to a “safe” environment**.
- You must **make sure that when outputting HTML to the page, you aren’t slowing down the page with a blocking operation**.
- You also have to **consider that your script might get included multiple times on the same page**, **and it should render multiple instances gracefully**.
- Additionally, you should **choose an optimal method for injecting CSS into the publisher’s page**
- either by
  - **inlining all your styles**
  - **appending link elements**
  - **or embedding CSS rules in your JavaScript**.
- But just getting HTML and CSS on the page isn’t enough.
- You **have to recognize that elements you introduce to the DOM can conflict with the parent page**.
- You also must **consider how your styles might conflict with existing styles defined by the publisher**.
- You can use a number of techniques for reducing the impact of parent styles on your widget:
  - by **overspecifying your CSS rules **
  - or presenting your **content behind an iframe, whether it’s a src-less iframe**
  - or one that **contains an external HTML document**.

#### Project Widget

- To recap where we are with the Camera Stork widget: at this point,
  - you should have a fully styled version of the widget loading on the publisher’s page that looks something like the example from figure 3.3.
- You want to maintain a consistent look and feel across every website, and customization is not a concern, so you’re rendering the widget’s contents inside of an iframe.

- The widget itself is still pretty static; it outputs up-to-date product information for a given product, but doesn’t capture or process any input from the user, like ratings or written reviews.
- To do that, you’ll have to learn how to communicate with the server, which is the topic of our next chapter.
