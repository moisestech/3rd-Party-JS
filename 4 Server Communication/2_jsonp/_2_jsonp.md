# JSONP

## **4.2 JSON with padding (JSONP)**

JSON with padding, or JSONP for short, is a pattern of usage that allows you to initiate
cross-domain HTTP requests from JavaScript while bypassing the same-origin policy
restriction. The term JSONP was coined back in 2005 when Bob Ippolito wrote a blog
post2
proposing “a new technology agnostic standard methodology for the script tag
method for cross-domain data fetching.” Since then, it has been widely adopted by

developers all around the web. Popular JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, have built-
in JSONP support, and many popular web service APIs (such as Twitter, Google, and of

course, Disqus) support JSONP responses.
In this section, we’ll show you how to use JSONP to circumvent the SOP and make
AJAX-like requests across domains. Then, at the end, we’ll clue you in to some JSONP
limitations and drawbacks.
