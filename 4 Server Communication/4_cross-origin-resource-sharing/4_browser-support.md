# Browser Support

## **4.4.4 Browser support**

All things considered, there’s solid support for cross-origin resource sharing among
modern browsers, but unfortunately it’s still a relatively unknown technology among
web developers. We believe that CORS can provide much better tools for cross-domain
AJAX and hopefully browsers will continue to improve their support for it. But what
should you be using today? We highly recommend that you try to use CORS whenever
possible and only fall back to other methods—such as JSONP—when it’s not available.
That way you’ll always be sure that as browsers continue improving their support for

CORS, your application won’t break and that you’ll always be using the most well-
defined technique available.

Table 4.2 shows you which browsers and which versions implement the CORS spec-
ification (also see http://caniuse.com/cors).
