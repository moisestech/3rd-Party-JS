## **10.2 Testing**

Developing a web application without tests is like playing Russian roulette with your
deploys: you might get lucky a few times, but sooner or later youâ€™ll push broken code
that will bring down your application. This isnâ€™t because youâ€™re a bad developer;
everyone makes mistakes. Web application bugs arenâ€™t always immediately obvious.

Bugs can be introduced by a completely unrelated change to the code youâ€™re modify-
ing, and itâ€™s hard to spot them without extensive, system-wide testing. This is why auto-
matic testing is extremely important for any software projectâ€”including third-party

JavaScript applications.
But testing third-party widgets isnâ€™t easy. You have to run tests in all supported
browsers and make sure that your tests cover common functionality as well as browser

quirks. In addition to that, most web-testing frameworks donâ€™t provide sufficient isola-
tion mechanisms for individual tests and test suites. This means that if your app uses

any kind of global stateâ€”and most nontrivial widgets doâ€”you have to manually reset
that state after each and every test or different tests can conflict with each other in
unpredictable ways. Same goes with regression testsâ€”tests that make sure you donâ€™t
introduce new bugs while pushing features. How do you write a test case that makes
sure Camera Stork works fine on pages that overwrite the special toJSON method
without affecting all other tests? In this section, weâ€™ll answer that question and others
in regard to testing third-party JavaScript applications, using different web-testing
frameworks and platforms. But first weâ€™ll go over different types of tests and explain
their purpose.
