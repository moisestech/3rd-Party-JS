# ðŸ”Ÿ Debugging & Testing

1. Debugging production code using **proxies and switches**
2. Stepping through code with the **JavaScript debugger**
3. **Testing with [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) and [Hiro](https://github.com/valueof/hiro)**

## **10.1 Debugging**

## **10.2 Testing**

## **10.3 Summary**

- Testing and debugging are things that most developers do reluctantly.
- It makes sense to debugâ€”after all, if youâ€™re debugging, it means that thereâ€™s a bug, someone found
  it, and this person is probably not happy about the whole situation.
- But now that you know how to approach bugs in third-party widgets, youâ€™re able to put all the pieces of
  information together and fix your next bug much quicker.
- In addition to that, you know how to **set up your testing and debugging environment in an unobtrusive but
  extremely helpful way**.

- Figure 10.7 Example **Hiro** output:
- green borders around each suite mean that both of them successfully passed.
- Once again, everything works as expected.

- And though debugging isnâ€™t pleasant, writing tests is fun!
- In this chapter, we covered two testing frameworks: **[QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) and [Hiro](https://github.com/valueof/hiro)**.
- Knowing how to use just one of them should be sufficient for covering your widgetâ€™s functionality with tests.
- So go write some tests!
- The earlier you start, the more confident youâ€™ll be when implementing new features and changing code.
- And **the more confident you are, the faster you can iterate with your third-party JavaScript application**.
- Whatâ€™s next? Profit!
