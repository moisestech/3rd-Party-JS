# Wraping APIs

## **8.3 Wrapping web service APIs**

So far in this chapter, we’ve looked at how a third-party JavaScript SDK can be used as an alternate, more-programmable method of distributing your application. But
there’s another valuable service an SDK can provide: acting as a client-side JavaScript
wrapper to your application’s web service API.
By client-side wrapper, we mean a set of handy functions that facilitate access to
your application’s web service API. Instead of communicating with your API directly,
using JSONP or even CORS, a publisher uses functions exposed by your SDK to initiate
requests to your API.
We’ll get down to implementing these functions shortly. But first, we’ll quickly
review web service APIs and discuss how a JavaScript wrapper offers advantages versus
direct client-side access using JSONP or CORS. Then, we’ll implement the API wrapper
function using easyXDM and cross-domain messaging. Last, we’ll discuss how to
ensure that only registered, identified publishers are capable of using your client-side
API functions.
First up, a quick refresher on web service APIs: what they are, how they work, and
what they’re good for.
