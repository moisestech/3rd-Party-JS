# 3rd Party JS SDK

1. Initializing an SDK synchronously & asynchronously
2. Exposing public functions
3. Versioning Techniques
4. Wrapping and communicating with a Web Services API

## **8.1 Implementing a bare-bones SDK**

## **8.2 Versioning**

## **8.3 Wrapping web service APIs**

## **8.4 Summary**

- Distributing a third-party JavaScript SDK is the natural evolution of any third-party
  JavaScript application.
- Providing easy-to-use functions that initialize and execute your application instances gives publishers more control over how they integrate your software with their web properties.
- In this chapter, we’ve covered the basics of converting your third-party application into a JavaScript SDK.
- You learned how to expose and implement an initialization method, as well as several possible techniques for guiding publishers to load your SDK asynchronously.
- You also implemented basic public functions for instantiating a Camera Stork product widget and for binding publisher callback functions to internal SDK events.
- Last, you learned how an SDK is an excellent tool for providing client-side access to a web services API and implemented a public function (Stork.api) that does so.
- Give yourself a pat on the back, because at this point, we’ve covered most of the functional basics of implementing third-party JavaScript applications.
- In the next chapter, we’ll look at optimizing the performance of these applications.
- After all, what good is a third-party application if it’s slow?
