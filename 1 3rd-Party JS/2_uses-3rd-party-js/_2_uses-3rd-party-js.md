# Uses of 3rd Party

## **1.2 The many uses of Third-Party Javascript**

Weâ€™ve established that **third-party JavaScript is code thatâ€™s being executed on someone elseâ€™s website**.
This gives **third-party code access to that websiteâ€™s HTML elements and JavaScript context**.

You can then manipulate that page in a number of ways, which might include:

1. **creating new elements on the DOM (Document Object Model).**
2. **inserting custom stylesheets**
3. **and registering browser events for capturing user actions.**

**For the most part, third-party scripts can perform any operation you might use JavaScript for on your own website or application, but instead, on someone elseâ€™s.**

**Figure 1.3 A Script-Loading snippet placed on the publisher's web page loads third-party JavaScript code.**

Armed with the power of remote web page manipulation, the question remains:

- what is it good for?

In this section, weâ€™ll look at some real-world use cases of third-party scripts:

- Embedded widgetsâ€”Small interactive applications embedded on the publisherâ€™s web page

1. Analytics and metricsâ€”For gathering intelligence about visitors and how they interact with the publisherâ€™s website.
2. Web service API wrappersâ€”For developing client-side applications that communicate with external web services.

This isnâ€™t a complete list, but should give you a solid idea of what third-party JavaScript is capable of.
Weâ€™ll start with an in-depth look at the first item: **embedded widgets**.
