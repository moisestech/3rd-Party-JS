# Unkwon Context

## 1.4.1 Unkown Context

- When a publisher includes your third-party script on their web page, often you know little about the context in which it’s being placed.
- Your script might get included on pages that sport a variety of different doctypes, DOM layouts, and CSS rules, and ought
  to work correctly in all of them.
- You have to consider that a publisher might include your script at the top of their page, in the <head> tag, or they might include it at the bottom of the <body>.
- Publishers might load your application inside an iframe, or on a page where the <head> tag is entirely absent; in HTML5, head sections are optional, and not all browsers automatically generate one internally.
- If your script makes assumptions about these core elements when querying or appending to the DOM, it could wind up in trouble.
- If you’re developing an embedded widget, displaying proper styles also becomes a concern.
- Is the widget being placed on a web page with a light background or a dark background?
- Do you want your widget to inherit styles and “blend” into the publisher’s web design, or do you want your widget to look identical in every context?

- What happens if the publisher’s HTML is malformed, causing the page to render in quirks mode?
- Solving these problems requires more than well-written CSS.
- We’ll cover solutions to these issues in later chapters.
