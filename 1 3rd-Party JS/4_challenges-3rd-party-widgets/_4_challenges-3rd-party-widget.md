## 1.4 Challenges Of Third-Party Development

Youâ€™ve learned how third-party JavaScript is a powerful way to write highly distributable applications. But writing scripts that run on other peopleâ€™s websites carries a unique set of challenges distinct from regular JavaScript programming. Specifically, your code is being executed in a DOM environment that you donâ€™t control, on a different domain. This means you have to contend with a number of unexpected complexities, like an unknown web page context, a JavaScript environment shared with other first- and third-party scripts, and even restrictions put in place by the browser. Weâ€™ll take a quick look at what each of these entails.
