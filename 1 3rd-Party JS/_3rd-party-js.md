### **1.4 Challenges of 3rd-Party Dev**

### **1.5 Summary**

- Third-party JavaScript is a powerful way of building **embedded and highly distributable web applications**.
- These applications can come in many shapes and sizes, but we looked at three specific use cases:
  - as **interactive widgets**
  - as **passive scripts that collect data**
  - and as **developer libraries that communicate with third-party web APIs.**

#### 3rd Party Challenges

- But compared to developing regular stay-at-home web applications, third-party scripts face additional challenges.
- They require you to execute your code in an:
  - **unknown**
  - **shared**
  - and **potentially hostile** browser environment.

#### Next Chapter

- We’ve only scratched the surface of what it means to write third-party scripts.
- In the next chapter, we’ll hit the ground running by covering the front-to-back creation of an embedded widget.
- This is one of the most common use cases for third-party JavaScript, and serves as an excellent starting place for covering third-party concepts and challenges.
