# Passing Args

## 2.5 Passing script arguments

Let’s recap. You’ve given the publisher the script include snippet, which they’ve added
to their web page’s HTML source code, and which is causing your application’s initial

script file to load on their page. After the script is loaded, it loads any additional sup-
porting JavaScript files. There’s another step in the application-loading process that

you’ll need to tackle before continuing: how to pass configuration parameters from
the publisher page to your application code.
Remember, the primary goal of the widget is to display product information for an
item that already exists in your product catalog. You’ll need to somehow identify this

product in the publisher script include snippet before you can retrieve any informa-
tion about it. We’ll look at four ways to do that: by embedding the product ID in the

target script URL’s query string; in the script URL’s hash fragment component; using
HTML5 custom data attributes; and separately, using global variables.
