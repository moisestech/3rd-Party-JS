# Config Env

## **2.1 Configuring your environment for Third-Party Development**

As we discussed in chapter 1, the web browser treats scripts that communicate with
external servers differently than regular script files. To tackle these issues head-on, it’s
highly recommended that you simulate a cross-domain environment on your local
development machine. If you don’t, it’s extremely likely that you’ll run into unforeseen
problems when you deploy your code onto live servers. We’re guessing you don’t want
that to happen, so in this next section, we’ll guide you through such a configuration.

Remember: your goal is to serve a script from your servers and have it loaded on a
publisher’s website. So to re-create that scenario, you’ll need to have a test page to
simulate a publisher’s website and a web server to serve your script from. You’ll also
need both the test page and script files served from different domains.
