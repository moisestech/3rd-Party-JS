# Web Server

## **2.1.2 The Web Server**

In order to serve your test page and script files to the browser, you’ll need to have web server software running on your local development machine. Even though you could use your web browser to open these files directly from your filesystem, they’ll be served using the file:// protocol, which doesn’t have a domain component. This will make simulating a cross-domain environment nigh impossible. Save yourself a world of pain and use a local web server.

If you’re not already using a local web server, don’t worry. Mac users will be pleased to know that the Apache web server is installed by default on OS X. If you’re doing your development on Windows, you’ll need to download and install Apache yourself.2

You can start Apache by running the following command in your terminal:
$ sudo apachectl start

By default, Apache on OS X (Mountain Lion) makes /Library/WebServer/ Documents/ available at http://localhost/. If you add your publisher test page named test.html to this Documents folder, it should be available at http://localhost/test.html. We’ll tweak these locations later in this tutorial. ANOTHER SOLUTION: BUILT-IN SERVERS If dedicated web server software like Apache feels a little heavy for you, most popular programming languages have built-in web server support. For example, you can easily start a web server in Python using the SimpleHTTPServer module, which comes installed with every Python installation:

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
Ad hoc web servers like this one have fewer features than full server offerings
like Apache, but they’re great at serving code quickly.
