## **2.7 Summary**

- There’s a lot of **up-front work to be done before you can render a widget on a publisher’s page**.

1. First, you’ve got to **distribute your script include snippet**,
   - **the entry point for loading the application**.
2. You then **need to load any dependencies**,
   - like **additional JavaScript files**, or **libraries**.
3. Last, you **need to pass identifying information from the host page to the application**,
   - so that you can **properly retrieve and submit data for the correct object**.

- You’ve seen how **there are a variety of techniques for implementing each of these first steps**.
- **Techniques that vary in complexity and scope**.
  - It’s up to you to **choose the techniques that best suit your application**.
- At this point, **product widget development** is well under way.

### **Project Widget**

- You’ve **given your loyal publishers a script include snippet**
  - that they’ve since **added to their HTML source code**.
- That **snippet is loading your initial script file**,
  - `widget.js`, onto their web page.
- That initial script has **loaded**
  - **all its dependent JavaScript files and libraries**.
- The script has **also extracted the product ID from the script include snippet**,
  - and **used that ID to extract the corresponding product information from the embedded catalog object**.

### **Next Chapter**

[[_html-css]]

- All this **code is executing on the publisher’s page**,
  - but **there’s nothing to see yet**.
- **The widget still hasn’t been rendered**.
- Luckily, this is the focus of the next chapter,
- **“Rendering HTML and CSS.”**
