# Loading Script

## 2.2 Loading the initial script

- Now that you’ve sorted out your development environment, it’s time to tackle how you’ll load your scripts on the publisher page.
- You’ll do this by using what we call the script include snippet.
- The script include snippet is one of the most important pieces of your application.
- It’s the code that’s distributed to publishers and will actually load your code on their web page.
- Not only does it have to work, but it has to load your files in the most efficient way possible.
- And there’s a penalty to getting it wrong, because getting publishers to update their web pages with a new version later is a painful undertaking.

- We’ll look at two include snippets that you can use to load the initial script on your publisher’s page: a standard, “blocking” `<script>` tag include, and an asynchronous script include.
