# Init Script

## 2.3 The initial script file

- At this point, the publisher is using your script include snippet, which is requesting a single script file from your servers and loading it onto their page.
- This file, `widget.js`, is the main entry point for your third-party application.
- It’s responsible for the whole show:

1. loading any additional code or resources,
2. fetching data about the product,
3. and ultimately rendering the widget on the page.

Here’s a high-level tour of `widget.js`.

**NAMESPACES IN JAVASCRIPT**

- You’ve probably seen namespace objects in JavaScript before.
- For example, the jQuery library puts all of its public meth- ods behind the jQuery object (jQuery also aliases this object to $ for convenience).
- Namespaces are common for nearly all JavaScript libraries, and are just good programming practice.
- For the most part, widget.js is empty; it’s just some boilerplate code that we’ll fill in shortly.
- But before we look at implementations to some of these stubbed-out functions, we want to highlight a few things.
