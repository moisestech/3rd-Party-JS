# Init Script

## 2.3 The initial script file

At this point, the publisher is using your script include snippet, which is requesting a
single script file from your servers and loading it onto their page. This file, widget.js, is
the main entry point for your third-party application. It’s responsible for the whole
show: loading any additional code or resources, fetching data about the product, and
ultimately rendering the widget on the page.
Here’s a high-level tour of widget.js.

NAMESPACES IN JAVASCRIPT You’ve probably seen namespace objects in

JavaScript before. For example, the jQuery library puts all of its public meth-
ods behind the jQuery object (jQuery also aliases this object to $ for conve-
nience). Namespaces are common for nearly all JavaScript libraries, and are

just good programming practice.
For the most part, widget.js is empty; it’s just some boilerplate code that we’ll fill in

shortly. But before we look at implementations to some of these stubbed-out func-
tions, we want to highlight a few things.
