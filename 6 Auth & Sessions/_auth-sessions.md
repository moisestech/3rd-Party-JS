## **6.4 Summary**

- **Authenticating and persisting sessions with third-party applications is tough to implement**, but not impossible.
- The **difficulty is that each browser treats disabling third-party cookies differently**, and you’ll need to supply different workaround solutions to support them all.
  - For **IE, Opera, and Safari, which transmit cookies to third-party domains if they’re already set, you can always open a new window to a login page on your domain and set the cookie there**.
  - **Safari can even use iframes, provided the session cookie is set in the response to a standard form POST HTTP request**.
  - **Chrome and Firefox, the most restrictive browsers with respect to third-party cookies, must make do with sessions that only last the duration of the user’s stay on the page**.
- Of course, just setting and sending a session cookie isn’t enough.
  - You also need to **transmit that cookie in such a way that it isn’t easily snoopable by malicious parties**.
- **The solution is to use HTTPS everywhere you send session information**.
- But if that’s not realistic for your organization, **you can use a mixed approach where high-touch actions are served behind HTTPS**,
  - **and actions performed from your third-party application use unencrypted HTTP**.
- **Session hijacking is, unfortunately, one of many possible security vulnerabilities** affecting third-party JavaScript applications.
- We’ve mentioned a handful of others over the course of this book.
